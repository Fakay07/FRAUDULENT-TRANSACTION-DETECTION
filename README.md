# 💳 FRAUDULENT TRANSACTION DETECTION

**End-to-End Machine Learning Pipeline for Financial Fraud Detection**

This project aims to detect fraudulent financial transactions using an end-to-end machine learning pipeline. It handles real-world challenges such as imbalanced datasets, domain-specific feature engineering, model evaluation, and explainability. The core model is powered by XGBoost, known for its speed and accuracy in structured/tabular data.

## 🧠 Project Objectives

- Build a supervised machine learning classifier to identify fraudulent transactions
- Handle extreme class imbalance using SMOTE
- Engineer features that reflect transaction anomalies
- Evaluate model performance using appropriate metrics (confusion matrix, ROC-AUC)
- Provide interpretability using SHAP to explain predictions to stakeholders

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

- **Accuracy**
- **Precision, Recall, F1-score**
- **ROC AUC Score**
- **Confusion Matrix**

These metrics help measure how well the model performs in a high-class-imbalance environment where simply predicting "non-fraud" all the time isn't acceptable.

## 🔎 Explainability with SHAP

To gain trust and ensure transparency in predictions, **SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)** is used to:
- Visualize which features contributed most to fraud classification
- Provide global and local feature attributions
- Assist stakeholders in understanding model behavior
