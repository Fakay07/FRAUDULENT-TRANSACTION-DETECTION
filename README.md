## üì• Installation

To set up this project on your local machine, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Fakay07/FRAUDULENT-TRANSACTION-DETECTION.git
   ```
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd FRAUDULENT-TRANSACTION-DETECTION
   ```

3. Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## üöÄ Usage

After installation, you can use the pipeline to detect fraudulent transactions. 

1. **Load Data**: Prepare your dataset in the required format.
2. **Run the Pipeline**: Execute the main script to train and evaluate the model.
3. **Analyze Results**: Review the output for insights into model performance.

## üß† Model Training

The model training process includes the following steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean and prepare the data for training.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extract relevant features to improve model performance.
3. **Train-Test Split**: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets.
4. **SMOTE Application**: Apply SMOTE to balance the dataset.
5. **Model Training**: Train the XGBoost classifier on the training set.

### Example Code

Here is a brief example of how to train the model:

```python
import pandas as pd
from xgboost import XGBClassifier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from imblearn.over_sampling import SMOTE

# Load your data
data = pd.read_csv('your_data.csv')

# Preprocess and feature engineering steps here

# Split data
X = data.drop('target', axis=1)
y = data['target']
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Apply SMOTE
smote = SMOTE()
X_resampled, y_resampled = smote.fit_resample(X_train, y_train)

# Train the model
model = XGBClassifier()
model.fit(X_resampled, y_resampled)
```

## üìä Evaluation

To evaluate the model's performance, you can use various metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The evaluation step provides insights into how well the model performs on unseen data.

### Example Evaluation Code

```python
from sklearn.metrics import classification_report

# Make predictions
y_pred = model.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model
print(classification_report(y_test, y_pred))
```
